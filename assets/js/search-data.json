Linear Regression . :label:sec_linear_regression . Regression refers to a set of methods for modeling the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. In the natural sciences and social sciences, the purpose of regression is most often to characterize the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Machine learning, on the other hand, is most often concerned with prediction. . Regression problems pop up whenever we want to predict a numerical value. Common examples include predicting prices (of homes, stocks, etc.), predicting length of stay (for patients in the hospital), demand forecasting (for retail sales), among countless others. Not every prediction problem is a classic regression problem. In subsequent sections, we will introduce classification problems, where the goal is to predict membership among a set of categories. . Basic Elements of Linear Regression . Linear regression may be both the simplest and most popular among the standard tools to regression. Dating back to the dawn of the 19th century, linear regression flows from a few simple assumptions. First, we assume that the relationship between the independent variables $ mathbf{x}$ and the dependent variable $y$ is linear, i.e., that $y$ can be expressed as a weighted sum of the elements in $ mathbf{x}$, given some noise on the observations. Second, we assume that any noise is well-behaved (following a Gaussian distribution). . To motivate the approach, let us start with a running example. Suppose that we wish to estimate the prices of houses (in dollars) based on their area (in square feet) and age (in years). To actually fit a model for predicting house prices, we would need to get our hands on a dataset consisting of sales for which we know the sale price, area, and age for each home. In the terminology of machine learning, the dataset is called a training data set or training set, and each row (here the data corresponding to one sale) is called an example (or data instance, data point, sample). The thing we are trying to predict (price) is called a label (or target). The independent variables (age and area) upon which the predictions are based are called features (or covariates). . Typically, we will use $n$ to denote the number of examples in our dataset. We index the data instances by $i$, denoting each input as $ mathbf{x}^{(i)} = [x_1^{(i)}, x_2^{(i)}]^ top$ and the corresponding label as $y^{(i)}$. . Linear Model . The linearity assumption just says that the target (price) can be expressed as a weighted sum of the features (area and age): . $$ mathrm{price} = w_{ mathrm{area}} cdot mathrm{area} + w_{ mathrm{age}} cdot mathrm{age} + b.$$ :eqlabel:eq:price-area . In :eqref:eq:price-area, $w_{ mathrm{area}}$ and $w_{ mathrm{age}}$ are called weights, and $b$ is called a bias (also called an offset or intercept). The weights determine the influence of each feature on our prediction and the bias just says what value the predicted price should take when all of the features take value 0. Even if we will never see any homes with zero area, or that are precisely zero years old, we still need the intercept or else we will limit the expressivity of our linear model. . Given a dataset, our goal is to choose the weights $ mathbf{w}$ and the bias $b$ such that on average, the predictions made according to our model best fit the true prices observed in the data. . In disciplines where it is common to focus on datasets with just a few features, explicitly expressing models long-form like this is common. In machine learning, we usually work with high-dimensional datasets, so it is more convenient to employ linear algebra notation. When our inputs consist of $d$ features, we express our prediction $ hat{y}$ as . $$ hat{y} = w_1 x_1 + ... + w_d x_d + b.$$ . Collecting all features into a vector $ mathbf{x} in mathbb{R}^d$ and all weights into a vector $ mathbf{w} in mathbb{R}^d$, we can express our model compactly using a dot product: . $$ hat{y} = mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x} + b.$$ :eqlabel:eq:linreg-y . In :eqref:eq:linreg-y, the vector $ mathbf{x}$ corresponds to features of a single data instance. We will often find it convenient to refer to features of our entire dataset of $n$ examples via the design matrix $ mathbf{X} in mathbb{R}^{n times d}$. Here, $ mathbf{X}$ contains one row for every example and one column for every feature. . For a collection of features $ mathbf{X}$, the predictions $ hat{ mathbf{y}} in mathbb{R}^n$ can be expressed via the matrix-vector product: . $${ hat{ mathbf{y}}} = mathbf{X} mathbf{w} + b,$$ . where broadcasting (see :numref:subsec_broadcasting) is applied during the summation. Given features of a training dataset $ mathbf{X}$ and corresponding (known) labels $ mathbf{y}$, the goal of linear regression is to find the weight vector $ mathbf{w}$ and the bias term $b$ that given features of a new data instance sampled from the same distribution as $ mathbf{X}$, the new data instance&#39;s label will (in expectation) be predicted with the lowest error. . Even if we believe that the best model for predicting $y$ given $ mathbf{x}$ is linear, we would not expect to find a real-world dataset of $n$ examples where $y^{(i)}$ exactly equals $ mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)}+b$ for all $1 leq i leq n$. For example, whatever instruments we use to observe the features $ mathbf{X}$ and labels $ mathbf{y}$ might suffer small amount of measurement error. Thus, even when we are confident that the underlying relationship is linear, we will incorporate a noise term to account for such errors. . Before we can go about searching for the best parameters $ mathbf{w}$ and $b$, we will need two more things: (i) a quality measure for some given model; and (ii) a procedure for updating the model to improve its quality. . Loss Function . Before we start thinking about how to fit our model, we need to determine a measure of fitness. The loss function quantifies the distance between the real and predicted value of the target. The loss will usually be a non-negative number where smaller values are better and perfect predictions incur a loss of $0$. The most popular loss function in regression problems is the sum of squared errors. When our prediction for an example $i$ is $ hat{y}^{(i)}$ and the corresponding true label is $y^{(i)}$, the squared error is given by: . $$l^{(i)}( mathbf{w}, b) = frac{1}{2} left( hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)} right)^2.$$ . The constant $1/2$ makes no real difference but will prove notationally convenient, cancelling out when we take the derivative of the loss. Since the training dataset is given to us, and thus out of our control, the empirical error is only a function of the model parameters. To make things more concrete, consider the example below where we plot a regression problem for a one-dimensional case as shown in :numref:fig_fit_linreg. . :label:fig_fit_linreg . Note that large differences between estimates $ hat{y}^{(i)}$ and observations $y^{(i)}$ lead to even larger contributions to the loss, due to the quadratic dependence. To measure the quality of a model on the entire dataset, we simply average (or equivalently, sum) the losses on the training set. . $$L( mathbf{w}, b) = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n l^{(i)}( mathbf{w}, b) = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{2} left( mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)} right)^2.$$ . When training the model, we want to find parameters ($ mathbf{w}^*, b^*$) that minimize the total loss across all training examples: . $$ mathbf{w}^*, b^* = operatorname*{argmin}_{ mathbf{w}, b} L( mathbf{w}, b).$$ . Analytic Solution . Linear regression happens to be an unusually simple optimization problem. Unlike most other models that we will encounter in this book, linear regression can be solved analytically by applying a simple formula, yielding a global optimum. To start, we can subsume the bias $b$ into the parameter $ mathbf{w}$ by appending a column to the design matrix consisting of all $1s$. Then our prediction problem is to minimize $|| mathbf{y} - mathbf{X} mathbf{w}||$. Because this expression has a quadratic form, it is convex, and so long as the problem is not degenerate (our features are linearly independent), it is strictly convex. . Thus there is just one critical point on the loss surface and it corresponds to the global minimum. Taking the derivative of the loss with respect to $ mathbf{w}$ and setting it equal to $0$ yields the analytic solution: . $$ mathbf{w}^* = ( mathbf X^ top mathbf X)^{-1} mathbf X^ top mathbf{y}.$$ . While simple problems like linear regression may admit analytic solutions, you should not get used to such good fortune. Although analytic solutions allow for nice mathematical analysis, the requirement of an analytic solution is so restrictive that it would exclude all of deep learning. . Gradient descent . Even in cases where we cannot solve the models analytically, and even when the loss surfaces are high-dimensional and nonconvex, it turns out that we can still train models effectively in practice. Moreover, for many tasks, these difficult-to-optimize models turn out to be so much better that figuring out how to train them ends up being well worth the trouble. . The key technique for optimizing nearly any deep learning model, and which we will call upon throughout this book, consists of iteratively reducing the error by updating the parameters in the direction that incrementally lowers the loss function. This algorithm is called gradient descent. On convex loss surfaces, it will eventually converge to a global minimum, and while the same cannot be said for nonconvex surfaces, it will at least lead towards a (hopefully good) local minimum. . The most naive application of gradient descent consists of taking the derivative of the true loss, which is an average of the losses computed on every single example in the dataset. In practice, this can be extremely slow. We must pass over the entire dataset before making a single update. Thus, we will often settle for sampling a random minibatch of examples every time we need to compute the update, a variant called stochastic gradient descent. . In each iteration, we first randomly sample a minibatch $ mathcal{B}$ consisting of a fixed number of training examples. We then compute the derivative (gradient) of the average loss on the mini batch with regard to the model parameters. Finally, we multiply the gradient by a predetermined step size $ eta &gt; 0$ and subtract the resulting term from the current parameter values. . We can express the update mathematically as follows ($ partial$ denotes the partial derivative) : . $$( mathbf{w},b) leftarrow ( mathbf{w},b) - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} partial_{( mathbf{w},b)} l^{(i)}( mathbf{w},b).$$ . To summarize, steps of the algorithm are the following: (i) we initialize the values of the model parameters, typically at random; (ii) we iteratively sample random batches from the data (many times), updating the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. . For quadratic losses and linear functions, we can write this out explicitly as follows: Note that $ mathbf{w}$ and $ mathbf{x}$ are vectors. Here, the more elegant vector notation makes the math much more readable than expressing things in terms of coefficients, say $w_1, w_2, ldots, w_d$. . $$ begin{aligned} mathbf{w} &amp; leftarrow mathbf{w} - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} partial_{ mathbf{w}} l^{(i)}( mathbf{w}, b) &amp;&amp; = mathbf{w} - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} mathbf{x}^{(i)} left( mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)} right), b &amp; leftarrow b - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} partial_b l^{(i)}( mathbf{w}, b) &amp;&amp; = b - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} left( mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)} right). end{aligned} $$In the above equation, $| mathcal{B}|$ represents the number of examples in each minibatch (the batch size) and $ eta$ denotes the learning rate. We emphasize that the values of the batch size and learning rate are manually pre-specified and not typically learned through model training. These parameters that are tunable but not updated in the training loop are called hyper-parameters. Hyperparameter tuning is the process by which these are chosen, and typically requires that we adjust the hyperparameters based on the results of the inner (training) loop as assessed on a separate validation split of the data. . After training for some predetermined number of iterations (or until some other stopping criteria is met), we record the estimated model parameters, denoted $ hat{ mathbf{w}}, hat{b}$ (in general the &quot;hat&quot; symbol denotes estimates). Note that even if our function is truly linear and noiseless, these parameters will not be the exact minimizers of the loss because, although the algorithm converges slowly towards a local minimum it cannot achieve it exactly in a finite number of steps. . Linear regression happens to be a convex learning problem, and thus there is only one (global) minimum. However, for more complicated models, like deep networks, the loss surfaces contain many minima. Fortunately, for reasons that are not yet fully understood, deep learning practitioners seldom struggle to find parameters that minimize the loss on training data. The more formidable task is to find parameters that will achieve low loss on data that we have not seen before, a challenge called generalization. We return to these topics throughout the book. . Making Predictions with the Learned Model . Given the learned linear regression model $ hat{ mathbf{w}}^ top mathbf{x} + hat{b}$, we can now estimate the price of a new house (not contained in the training data) given its area $x_1$ and age (year) $x_2$. Estimating targets given features is commonly called prediction and inference. . We will try to stick with prediction because calling this step inference, despite emerging as standard jargon in deep learning, is somewhat of a misnomer. In statistics, inference more often denotes estimating parameters based on a dataset. This misuse of terminology is a common source of confusion when deep learning practitioners talk to statisticians. . Vectorization for Speed . When training our models, we typically want to process whole minibatches of examples simultaneously. Doing this efficiently requires that we vectorize the calculations and leverage fast linear algebra libraries rather than writing costly for-loops in Python. . To illustrate why this matters so much, we can consider two methods for adding vectors. To start we instantiate two $10000$-dimensional vectors containing all ones. In one method we will loop over the vectors with a Python for loop. In the other method we will rely on a single call to +. . %matplotlib inline from d2l import mxnet as d2l import math from mxnet import np import time n = 10000 a = np.ones(n) b = np.ones(n) . Since we will benchmark the running time frequently in this book, let us define a timer (hereafter accessed via the d2l package to track the running time. . class Timer: #@save &quot;&quot;&quot;Record multiple running times.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self): self.times = [] self.start() def start(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Start the timer.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.tik = time.time() def stop(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Stop the timer and record the time in a list.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.times.append(time.time() - self.tik) return self.times[-1] def avg(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the average time.&quot;&quot;&quot; return sum(self.times) / len(self.times) def sum(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the sum of time.&quot;&quot;&quot; return sum(self.times) def cumsum(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the accumulated times.&quot;&quot;&quot; return np.array(self.times).cumsum().tolist() . Now we can benchmark the workloads. First, we add them, one coordinate at a time, using a for loop. . c = np.zeros(n) timer = Timer() for i in range(n): c[i] = a[i] + b[i] f&#39;{timer.stop():.5f} sec&#39; . &#39;4.18153 sec&#39; . Alternatively, we rely on the reloaded + operator to compute the elementwise sum: . timer.start() d = a + b f&#39;{timer.stop():.5f} sec&#39; . &#39;0.00025 sec&#39; . You probably noticed that the second method is dramatically faster than the first. Vectorizing code often yields order-of-magnitude speedups. Moreover, we push more of the math to the library and need not write as many calculations ourselves, reducing the potential for errors. . The Normal Distribution and Squared Loss . While you can already get your hands dirty using only the information above, in the following section we can more formally motivate the square loss objective via assumptions about the distribution of noise. . Recall from the above that the squared loss $l(y, hat{y}) = frac{1}{2} (y - hat{y})^2$ has many convenient properties. These include a simple derivative $ partial_{ hat{y}} l(y, hat{y}) = ( hat{y} - y)$. . As we mentioned earlier, linear regression was invented by Gauss in 1795, who also discovered the normal distribution (also called the Gaussian). It turns out that the connection between the normal distribution and linear regression runs deeper than common parentage. To refresh your memory, the probability density of a normal distribution with mean $ mu$ and variance $ sigma^2$ is given as follows: . $$p(z) = frac{1}{ sqrt{2 pi sigma^2}} exp left(- frac{1}{2 sigma^2} (z - mu)^2 right).$$ . Below we define a Python function to compute the normal distribution. . def normal(z, mu, sigma): p = 1 / math.sqrt(2 * math.pi * sigma**2) return p * np.exp(- 0.5 / sigma**2 * (z - mu)**2) . We can now visualize the normal distributions. . # Using numpy again for visualizations. x = np.arange(-7, 7, 0.01) # Mean and variance pairs parameters = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 1)] d2l.plot(x, [normal(x, mu, sigma) for mu, sigma in parameters], xlabel=&#39;z&#39;, ylabel=&#39;p(z)&#39;, figsize=(4.5, 2.5), legend=[&#39;mean %d, var %d&#39; % (mu, sigma) for mu, sigma in parameters]) . &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt; As you can see, changing the mean corresponds to a shift along the x axis, and increasing the variance spreads the distribution out, lowering its peak. . One way to motivate linear regression with the mean squared error loss function is to formally assume that observations arise from noisy observations, where the noise is normally distributed as follows . $$y = mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x} + b + epsilon text{ where } epsilon sim mathcal{N}(0, sigma^2).$$ . Thus, we can now write out the likelihood of seeing a particular $y$ for a given $ mathbf{x}$ via . $$p(y| mathbf{x}) = frac{1}{ sqrt{2 pi sigma^2}} exp left(- frac{1}{2 sigma^2} (y - mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x} - b)^2 right).$$ . Now, according to the maximum likelihood principle, the best values of $b$ and $ mathbf{w}$ are those that maximize the likelihood of the entire dataset: . $$P(Y mid X) = prod_{i=1}^{n} p(y^{(i)}| mathbf{x}^{(i)}).$$ . Estimators chosen according to the maximum likelihood principle are called Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE). While, maximizing the product of many exponential functions, might look difficult, we can simplify things significantly, without changing the objective, by maximizing the log of the likelihood instead. For historical reasons, optimizations are more often expressed as minimization rather than maximization. So, without changing anything we can minimize the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) $- log p( mathbf y| mathbf X)$. Working out the math gives us: . $$- log p( mathbf y| mathbf X) = sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{2} log(2 pi sigma^2) + frac{1}{2 sigma^2} left(y^{(i)} - mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)} - b right)^2.$$ . Now we just need one more assumption: that $ sigma$ is some fixed constant. Thus we can ignore the first term because it does not depend on $ mathbf{w}$ or $b$. Now the second term is identical to the squared error objective introduced earlier, but for the multiplicative constant $ frac{1}{ sigma^2}$. Fortunately, the solution does not depend on $ sigma$. It follows that minimizing squared error is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of a linear model under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise. . From Linear Regression to Deep Networks . So far we only talked about linear functions. While neural networks cover a much richer family of models, we can begin thinking of the linear model as a neural network by expressing it in the language of neural networks. To begin, let us start by rewriting things in a &#39;layer&#39; notation. . Neural Network Diagram . Deep learning practitioners like to draw diagrams to visualize what is happening in their models. In :numref:fig_single_neuron, we depict our linear model as a neural network. Note that these diagrams indicate the connectivity pattern (here, each input is connected to the output) but not the values taken by the weights or biases. . :label:fig_single_neuron . Because there is just a single computed neuron (node) in the graph (the input values are not computed but given), we can think of linear models as neural networks consisting of just a single artificial neuron. Since for this model, every input is connected to every output (in this case there is only one output!), we can regard this transformation as a fully-connected layer, also commonly called a dense layer. We will talk a lot more about networks composed of such layers in the next chapter on multilayer perceptrons. . Biology . Since linear regression (invented in 1795) predates computational neuroscience, it might seem anachronistic to describe linear regression as a neural network. To see why linear models were a natural place to begin when the cyberneticists/neurophysiologists Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts began to develop models of artificial neurons, consider the cartoonish picture of a biological neuron in :numref:fig_Neuron, consisting of dendrites (input terminals), the nucleus (CPU), the axon (output wire), and the axon terminals (output terminals), enabling connections to other neurons via synapses. . :label:fig_Neuron . Information $x_i$ arriving from other neurons (or environmental sensors such as the retina) is received in the dendrites. In particular, that information is weighted by synaptic weights $w_i$ determining the effect of the inputs (e.g., activation or inhibition via the product $x_i w_i$). The weighted inputs arriving from multiple sources are aggregated in the nucleus as a weighted sum $y = sum_i x_i w_i + b$, and this information is then sent for further processing in the axon $y$, typically after some nonlinear processing via $ sigma(y)$. From there it either reaches its destination (e.g., a muscle) or is fed into another neuron via its dendrites. . Certainly, the high-level idea that many such units could be cobbled together with the right connectivity and right learning algorithm, to produce far more interesting and complex behavior than any one neuron alone could express owes to our study of real biological neural systems. . At the same time, most research in deep learning today draws little direct inspiration in neuroscience. We invoke Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig who, in their classic AI text book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach :cite:Russell.Norvig.2016, pointed out that although airplanes might have been inspired by birds, ornithology has not been the primary driver of aeronautics innovation for some centuries. Likewise, inspiration in deep learning these days comes in equal or greater measure from mathematics, statistics, and computer science. . Summary .

Basic Elements of Linear Regression . Linear regression may be both the simplest and most popular among the standard tools to regression. Dating back to the dawn of the 19th century, linear regression flows from a few simple assumptions. First, we assume that the relationship between the independent variables $ mathbf{x}$ and the dependent variable $y$ is linear, i.e., that $y$ can be expressed as a weighted sum of the elements in $ mathbf{x}$, given some noise on the observations. Second, we assume that any noise is well-behaved (following a Gaussian distribution). . To motivate the approach, let us start with a running example. Suppose that we wish to estimate the prices of houses (in dollars) based on their area (in square feet) and age (in years). To actually fit a model for predicting house prices, we would need to get our hands on a dataset consisting of sales for which we know the sale price, area, and age for each home. In the terminology of machine learning, the dataset is called a training data set or training set, and each row (here the data corresponding to one sale) is called an example (or data instance, data point, sample). The thing we are trying to predict (price) is called a label (or target). The independent variables (age and area) upon which the predictions are based are called features (or covariates). . Typically, we will use $n$ to denote the number of examples in our dataset. We index the data instances by $i$, denoting each input as $ mathbf{x}^{(i)} = [x_1^{(i)}, x_2^{(i)}]^ top$ and the corresponding label as $y^{(i)}$. . Linear Model . The linearity assumption just says that the target (price) can be expressed as a weighted sum of the features (area and age): . $$ mathrm{price} = w_{ mathrm{area}} cdot mathrm{area} + w_{ mathrm{age}} cdot mathrm{age} + b.$$ :eqlabel:eq:price-area . In :eqref:eq:price-area, $w_{ mathrm{area}}$ and $w_{ mathrm{age}}$ are called weights, and $b$ is called a bias (also called an offset or intercept). The weights determine the influence of each feature on our prediction and the bias just says what value the predicted price should take when all of the features take value 0. Even if we will never see any homes with zero area, or that are precisely zero years old, we still need the intercept or else we will limit the expressivity of our linear model. . Given a dataset, our goal is to choose the weights $ mathbf{w}$ and the bias $b$ such that on average, the predictions made according to our model best fit the true prices observed in the data. . In disciplines where it is common to focus on datasets with just a few features, explicitly expressing models long-form like this is common. In machine learning, we usually work with high-dimensional datasets, so it is more convenient to employ linear algebra notation. When our inputs consist of $d$ features, we express our prediction $ hat{y}$ as . $$ hat{y} = w_1 x_1 + ... + w_d x_d + b.$$ . Collecting all features into a vector $ mathbf{x} in mathbb{R}^d$ and all weights into a vector $ mathbf{w} in mathbb{R}^d$, we can express our model compactly using a dot product: . $$ hat{y} = mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x} + b.$$ :eqlabel:eq:linreg-y . In :eqref:eq:linreg-y, the vector $ mathbf{x}$ corresponds to features of a single data instance. We will often find it convenient to refer to features of our entire dataset of $n$ examples via the design matrix $ mathbf{X} in mathbb{R}^{n times d}$. Here, $ mathbf{X}$ contains one row for every example and one column for every feature. . For a collection of features $ mathbf{X}$, the predictions $ hat{ mathbf{y}} in mathbb{R}^n$ can be expressed via the matrix-vector product: . $${ hat{ mathbf{y}}} = mathbf{X} mathbf{w} + b,$$ . where broadcasting (see :numref:subsec_broadcasting) is applied during the summation. Given features of a training dataset $ mathbf{X}$ and corresponding (known) labels $ mathbf{y}$, the goal of linear regression is to find the weight vector $ mathbf{w}$ and the bias term $b$ that given features of a new data instance sampled from the same distribution as $ mathbf{X}$, the new data instance&#39;s label will (in expectation) be predicted with the lowest error. . Even if we believe that the best model for predicting $y$ given $ mathbf{x}$ is linear, we would not expect to find a real-world dataset of $n$ examples where $y^{(i)}$ exactly equals $ mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)}+b$ for all $1 leq i leq n$. For example, whatever instruments we use to observe the features $ mathbf{X}$ and labels $ mathbf{y}$ might suffer small amount of measurement error. Thus, even when we are confident that the underlying relationship is linear, we will incorporate a noise term to account for such errors. . Before we can go about searching for the best parameters $ mathbf{w}$ and $b$, we will need two more things: (i) a quality measure for some given model; and (ii) a procedure for updating the model to improve its quality. . Loss Function . Before we start thinking about how to fit our model, we need to determine a measure of fitness. The loss function quantifies the distance between the real and predicted value of the target. The loss will usually be a non-negative number where smaller values are better and perfect predictions incur a loss of $0$. The most popular loss function in regression problems is the sum of squared errors. When our prediction for an example $i$ is $ hat{y}^{(i)}$ and the corresponding true label is $y^{(i)}$, the squared error is given by: . $$l^{(i)}( mathbf{w}, b) = frac{1}{2} left( hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)} right)^2.$$ . The constant $1/2$ makes no real difference but will prove notationally convenient, cancelling out when we take the derivative of the loss. Since the training dataset is given to us, and thus out of our control, the empirical error is only a function of the model parameters. To make things more concrete, consider the example below where we plot a regression problem for a one-dimensional case as shown in :numref:fig_fit_linreg. . :label:fig_fit_linreg . Note that large differences between estimates $ hat{y}^{(i)}$ and observations $y^{(i)}$ lead to even larger contributions to the loss, due to the quadratic dependence. To measure the quality of a model on the entire dataset, we simply average (or equivalently, sum) the losses on the training set. . $$L( mathbf{w}, b) = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n l^{(i)}( mathbf{w}, b) = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{2} left( mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)} right)^2.$$ . When training the model, we want to find parameters ($ mathbf{w}^*, b^*$) that minimize the total loss across all training examples: . $$ mathbf{w}^*, b^* = operatorname*{argmin}_{ mathbf{w}, b} L( mathbf{w}, b).$$ . Analytic Solution . Linear regression happens to be an unusually simple optimization problem. Unlike most other models that we will encounter in this book, linear regression can be solved analytically by applying a simple formula, yielding a global optimum. To start, we can subsume the bias $b$ into the parameter $ mathbf{w}$ by appending a column to the design matrix consisting of all $1s$. Then our prediction problem is to minimize $|| mathbf{y} - mathbf{X} mathbf{w}||$. Because this expression has a quadratic form, it is convex, and so long as the problem is not degenerate (our features are linearly independent), it is strictly convex. . Thus there is just one critical point on the loss surface and it corresponds to the global minimum. Taking the derivative of the loss with respect to $ mathbf{w}$ and setting it equal to $0$ yields the analytic solution: . $$ mathbf{w}^* = ( mathbf X^ top mathbf X)^{-1} mathbf X^ top mathbf{y}.$$ . While simple problems like linear regression may admit analytic solutions, you should not get used to such good fortune. Although analytic solutions allow for nice mathematical analysis, the requirement of an analytic solution is so restrictive that it would exclude all of deep learning. . Gradient descent . Even in cases where we cannot solve the models analytically, and even when the loss surfaces are high-dimensional and nonconvex, it turns out that we can still train models effectively in practice. Moreover, for many tasks, these difficult-to-optimize models turn out to be so much better that figuring out how to train them ends up being well worth the trouble. . The key technique for optimizing nearly any deep learning model, and which we will call upon throughout this book, consists of iteratively reducing the error by updating the parameters in the direction that incrementally lowers the loss function. This algorithm is called gradient descent. On convex loss surfaces, it will eventually converge to a global minimum, and while the same cannot be said for nonconvex surfaces, it will at least lead towards a (hopefully good) local minimum. . The most naive application of gradient descent consists of taking the derivative of the true loss, which is an average of the losses computed on every single example in the dataset. In practice, this can be extremely slow. We must pass over the entire dataset before making a single update. Thus, we will often settle for sampling a random minibatch of examples every time we need to compute the update, a variant called stochastic gradient descent. . In each iteration, we first randomly sample a minibatch $ mathcal{B}$ consisting of a fixed number of training examples. We then compute the derivative (gradient) of the average loss on the mini batch with regard to the model parameters. Finally, we multiply the gradient by a predetermined step size $ eta &gt; 0$ and subtract the resulting term from the current parameter values. . We can express the update mathematically as follows ($ partial$ denotes the partial derivative) : . $$( mathbf{w},b) leftarrow ( mathbf{w},b) - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} partial_{( mathbf{w},b)} l^{(i)}( mathbf{w},b).$$ . To summarize, steps of the algorithm are the following: (i) we initialize the values of the model parameters, typically at random; (ii) we iteratively sample random batches from the data (many times), updating the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. . For quadratic losses and linear functions, we can write this out explicitly as follows: Note that $ mathbf{w}$ and $ mathbf{x}$ are vectors. Here, the more elegant vector notation makes the math much more readable than expressing things in terms of coefficients, say $w_1, w_2, ldots, w_d$. . $$ begin{aligned} mathbf{w} &amp; leftarrow mathbf{w} - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} partial_{ mathbf{w}} l^{(i)}( mathbf{w}, b) &amp;&amp; = mathbf{w} - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} mathbf{x}^{(i)} left( mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)} right), b &amp; leftarrow b - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} partial_b l^{(i)}( mathbf{w}, b) &amp;&amp; = b - frac{ eta}{| mathcal{B}|} sum_{i in mathcal{B}} left( mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)} right). end{aligned} $$In the above equation, $| mathcal{B}|$ represents the number of examples in each minibatch (the batch size) and $ eta$ denotes the learning rate. We emphasize that the values of the batch size and learning rate are manually pre-specified and not typically learned through model training. These parameters that are tunable but not updated in the training loop are called hyper-parameters. Hyperparameter tuning is the process by which these are chosen, and typically requires that we adjust the hyperparameters based on the results of the inner (training) loop as assessed on a separate validation split of the data. . After training for some predetermined number of iterations (or until some other stopping criteria is met), we record the estimated model parameters, denoted $ hat{ mathbf{w}}, hat{b}$ (in general the &quot;hat&quot; symbol denotes estimates). Note that even if our function is truly linear and noiseless, these parameters will not be the exact minimizers of the loss because, although the algorithm converges slowly towards a local minimum it cannot achieve it exactly in a finite number of steps. . Linear regression happens to be a convex learning problem, and thus there is only one (global) minimum. However, for more complicated models, like deep networks, the loss surfaces contain many minima. Fortunately, for reasons that are not yet fully understood, deep learning practitioners seldom struggle to find parameters that minimize the loss on training data. The more formidable task is to find parameters that will achieve low loss on data that we have not seen before, a challenge called generalization. We return to these topics throughout the book. . Making Predictions with the Learned Model . Given the learned linear regression model $ hat{ mathbf{w}}^ top mathbf{x} + hat{b}$, we can now estimate the price of a new house (not contained in the training data) given its area $x_1$ and age (year) $x_2$. Estimating targets given features is commonly called prediction and inference. . We will try to stick with prediction because calling this step inference, despite emerging as standard jargon in deep learning, is somewhat of a misnomer. In statistics, inference more often denotes estimating parameters based on a dataset. This misuse of terminology is a common source of confusion when deep learning practitioners talk to statisticians. . Vectorization for Speed . When training our models, we typically want to process whole minibatches of examples simultaneously. Doing this efficiently requires that we vectorize the calculations and leverage fast linear algebra libraries rather than writing costly for-loops in Python. . To illustrate why this matters so much, we can consider two methods for adding vectors. To start we instantiate two $10000$-dimensional vectors containing all ones. In one method we will loop over the vectors with a Python for loop. In the other method we will rely on a single call to +. . %matplotlib inline from d2l import mxnet as d2l import math from mxnet import np import time n = 10000 a = np.ones(n) b = np.ones(n) . Since we will benchmark the running time frequently in this book, let us define a timer (hereafter accessed via the d2l package to track the running time. . class Timer: #@save &quot;&quot;&quot;Record multiple running times.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self): self.times = [] self.start() def start(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Start the timer.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.tik = time.time() def stop(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Stop the timer and record the time in a list.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.times.append(time.time() - self.tik) return self.times[-1] def avg(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the average time.&quot;&quot;&quot; return sum(self.times) / len(self.times) def sum(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the sum of time.&quot;&quot;&quot; return sum(self.times) def cumsum(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the accumulated times.&quot;&quot;&quot; return np.array(self.times).cumsum().tolist() . Now we can benchmark the workloads. First, we add them, one coordinate at a time, using a for loop. . c = np.zeros(n) timer = Timer() for i in range(n): c[i] = a[i] + b[i] f&#39;{timer.stop():.5f} sec&#39; . &#39;4.18153 sec&#39; . Alternatively, we rely on the reloaded + operator to compute the elementwise sum: . timer.start() d = a + b f&#39;{timer.stop():.5f} sec&#39; . &#39;0.00025 sec&#39; . You probably noticed that the second method is dramatically faster than the first. Vectorizing code often yields order-of-magnitude speedups. Moreover, we push more of the math to the library and need not write as many calculations ourselves, reducing the potential for errors. . The Normal Distribution and Squared Loss . While you can already get your hands dirty using only the information above, in the following section we can more formally motivate the square loss objective via assumptions about the distribution of noise. . Recall from the above that the squared loss $l(y, hat{y}) = frac{1}{2} (y - hat{y})^2$ has many convenient properties. These include a simple derivative $ partial_{ hat{y}} l(y, hat{y}) = ( hat{y} - y)$. . As we mentioned earlier, linear regression was invented by Gauss in 1795, who also discovered the normal distribution (also called the Gaussian). It turns out that the connection between the normal distribution and linear regression runs deeper than common parentage. To refresh your memory, the probability density of a normal distribution with mean $ mu$ and variance $ sigma^2$ is given as follows: . $$p(z) = frac{1}{ sqrt{2 pi sigma^2}} exp left(- frac{1}{2 sigma^2} (z - mu)^2 right).$$ . Below we define a Python function to compute the normal distribution. . def normal(z, mu, sigma): p = 1 / math.sqrt(2 * math.pi * sigma**2) return p * np.exp(- 0.5 / sigma**2 * (z - mu)**2) . We can now visualize the normal distributions. . # Using numpy again for visualizations. x = np.arange(-7, 7, 0.01) # Mean and variance pairs parameters = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 1)] d2l.plot(x, [normal(x, mu, sigma) for mu, sigma in parameters], xlabel=&#39;z&#39;, ylabel=&#39;p(z)&#39;, figsize=(4.5, 2.5), legend=[&#39;mean %d, var %d&#39; % (mu, sigma) for mu, sigma in parameters]) . &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt; As you can see, changing the mean corresponds to a shift along the x axis, and increasing the variance spreads the distribution out, lowering its peak. . One way to motivate linear regression with the mean squared error loss function is to formally assume that observations arise from noisy observations, where the noise is normally distributed as follows . $$y = mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x} + b + epsilon text{ where } epsilon sim mathcal{N}(0, sigma^2).$$ . Thus, we can now write out the likelihood of seeing a particular $y$ for a given $ mathbf{x}$ via . $$p(y| mathbf{x}) = frac{1}{ sqrt{2 pi sigma^2}} exp left(- frac{1}{2 sigma^2} (y - mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x} - b)^2 right).$$ . Now, according to the maximum likelihood principle, the best values of $b$ and $ mathbf{w}$ are those that maximize the likelihood of the entire dataset: . $$P(Y mid X) = prod_{i=1}^{n} p(y^{(i)}| mathbf{x}^{(i)}).$$ . Estimators chosen according to the maximum likelihood principle are called Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE). While, maximizing the product of many exponential functions, might look difficult, we can simplify things significantly, without changing the objective, by maximizing the log of the likelihood instead. For historical reasons, optimizations are more often expressed as minimization rather than maximization. So, without changing anything we can minimize the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) $- log p( mathbf y| mathbf X)$. Working out the math gives us: . $$- log p( mathbf y| mathbf X) = sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{2} log(2 pi sigma^2) + frac{1}{2 sigma^2} left(y^{(i)} - mathbf{w}^ top mathbf{x}^{(i)} - b right)^2.$$ . Now we just need one more assumption: that $ sigma$ is some fixed constant. Thus we can ignore the first term because it does not depend on $ mathbf{w}$ or $b$. Now the second term is identical to the squared error objective introduced earlier, but for the multiplicative constant $ frac{1}{ sigma^2}$. Fortunately, the solution does not depend on $ sigma$. It follows that minimizing squared error is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of a linear model under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise. . From Linear Regression to Deep Networks . So far we only talked about linear functions. While neural networks cover a much richer family of models, we can begin thinking of the linear model as a neural network by expressing it in the language of neural networks. To begin, let us start by rewriting things in a &#39;layer&#39; notation. . Neural Network Diagram . Deep learning practitioners like to draw diagrams to visualize what is happening in their models. In :numref:fig_single_neuron, we depict our linear model as a neural network. Note that these diagrams indicate the connectivity pattern (here, each input is connected to the output) but not the values taken by the weights or biases. . :label:fig_single_neuron . Because there is just a single computed neuron (node) in the graph (the input values are not computed but given), we can think of linear models as neural networks consisting of just a single artificial neuron. Since for this model, every input is connected to every output (in this case there is only one output!), we can regard this transformation as a fully-connected layer, also commonly called a dense layer. We will talk a lot more about networks composed of such layers in the next chapter on multilayer perceptrons. . Biology . Since linear regression (invented in 1795) predates computational neuroscience, it might seem anachronistic to describe linear regression as a neural network. To see why linear models were a natural place to begin when the cyberneticists/neurophysiologists Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts began to develop models of artificial neurons, consider the cartoonish picture of a biological neuron in :numref:fig_Neuron, consisting of dendrites (input terminals), the nucleus (CPU), the axon (output wire), and the axon terminals (output terminals), enabling connections to other neurons via synapses. . :label:fig_Neuron . Information $x_i$ arriving from other neurons (or environmental sensors such as the retina) is received in the dendrites. In particular, that information is weighted by synaptic weights $w_i$ determining the effect of the inputs (e.g., activation or inhibition via the product $x_i w_i$). The weighted inputs arriving from multiple sources are aggregated in the nucleus as a weighted sum $y = sum_i x_i w_i + b$, and this information is then sent for further processing in the axon $y$, typically after some nonlinear processing via $ sigma(y)$. From there it either reaches its destination (e.g., a muscle) or is fed into another neuron via its dendrites. . Certainly, the high-level idea that many such units could be cobbled together with the right connectivity and right learning algorithm, to produce far more interesting and complex behavior than any one neuron alone could express owes to our study of real biological neural systems. . At the same time, most research in deep learning today draws little direct inspiration in neuroscience. We invoke Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig who, in their classic AI text book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach :cite:Russell.Norvig.2016, pointed out that although airplanes might have been inspired by birds, ornithology has not been the primary driver of aeronautics innovation for some centuries. Likewise, inspiration in deep learning these days comes in equal or greater measure from mathematics, statistics, and computer science. . Summary . Key ingredients in a machine learning model are training data, a loss function, an optimization algorithm, and quite obviously, the model itself. | Vectorizing makes everything better (mostly math) and faster (mostly code). | Minimizing an objective function and performing maximum likelihood can mean the same thing. | Linear models are neural networks, too. | . Exercises . Assume that we have some data $x_1, ldots, x_n in mathbb{R}$. Our goal is to find a constant $b$ such that $ sum_i (x_i - b)^2$ is minimized.

            "content": "Makine Öğrenmesi tamamen tahminler üretme işidir. Örneğin klinik geçmişi göz önüne alındığında, bir hastanın gelecek yıl kalp krizi geçirme olasılığını tahmin etmek isteyebiliriz. Anormallik tespitinde, bir uçağın jet motorundan gelen bir dizi okumanın normal çalışma için ne kadar olası olduğunu değerlendirmek isteyebiliriz. Pekiştirmeli öğrenmede, robotun ya da daha genel olarak etmenin bir ortamda akıllıca davranmasını isteriz. Bunun anlamı, mevcut eylemlerin her biri altında yüksek bir ödül alma olasılığını düşünmemiz gerektiğidir. Tavsiye sistemleri inşa ettiğimizde de olasılıkları düşünmemiz gerekir. Örneğin, büyük bir online kitapçı için çalıştığımızı varsayalım. Belirli bir kullanıcının belirli bir kitabı satın alma olasılığını tahmin etmek isteyebiliriz. Tüm bu durumlar için olasılık dilini kullanmalıyız. Bir çok kurs, ana bilim dalları, tezler, kariyerler ve hatta bölümler olasılık bilimine üzerine kurulmuştur. Doğal olarak, bu bölümdeki amacımız tüm olasılık konularını öğretmek değildir. Bunun yerine sıfırdan, size ilk derin öğrenme modellerinizi oluşturmaya başlayabileceğiniz kadar olasılık bilgisi öğretmeyi ve isterseniz konunun kendi kendinize keşfetmeye başlayabileceğiniz kadarlık özünü kavratmak istiyoruz. . Açık açık ifade etmesek veya somut örnekler vermesek de, önceki bölümlerde olaslığı kullandık. Şimdi ilk örneğimizle başlayaşım: kedi ve köpekleri fotoğraflardan ayırt etmek. Bu basit gelebilir ama aslında zor bir problemdir. Sorunun zorluğu ilk planda görüntünün çözünürlüğüne bağlı olabilir. . . Şekilde görüldüğü gibi, $160 times 160$ piksel çözünürlüğe sahip resimlerde kedi ve köpekleri seçmek bizim için kolay olsa da, $40 times 40$ piksel için zor hata $10 times 10$ piksel için imkansızdır. Diğer bir ifadeyle, uzaklaştıkça yani çözünürlük azaldıkça kedi ve köpek resimlerini ayırt etmemiz yazı-tura atmaya dönüşmeye başlar. Olasılık sayesinde belirsizlik düzeyini matematiksel olarak ifade edebiliriz. Eğer resmim kedi resmi olduğundan tam olarak eminsek, resme karşılık gelen $y$ etiketinin &quot;kedi&quot; olma olasılığı yani $P(y=$ &quot;kedi&quot;$)$ ifadesi $1$ sayısına eşittir deriz. Fakat $y =$ &quot;kedi&quot; veya that $y =$ &quot;köpek&quot; diyebilmek için herhangi bir bulgu yok ise, olasılıkların eşit olduğunu söyler ve bunu $P(y=$ &quot;kedi&quot;$) = P(y=$ &quot;köpek&quot;$) = 0.5$ şeklinde gösteririz. Eğer resmin kedi resminden olduğu yüksek ihtimal ise fakat kesin emin değilsek, olasılığı $0.5 &lt; P(y=$ &quot;kedi&quot;$) &lt; 1$ gibi bir değer olarak tahmin ederiz. . Şimdi diğer bir örnek verelim. Hava durumu izleme verilerinden yarın İstanbul&#39;da yağmur yağma olaslığını tahmin etmek istiyoruz. Yaz aylarındaysak yağmur yaklaşık 0.5 olasılıkla yağar. . İki örnekte de bir şeyin alacağı değerle ilgileniyoruz. Ayrıca ikisinde de sonuçtan kesin emin değiliz. Fakat iki durum arasında kritik bir farklılık var. İlk durumda resim ya kedidir ya da köpektir ve hangisi olduğunu kesin bilmiyoruz. İkinci durumda sonuç rastgele bir olay gibi görülebilir. Dolayısıyla olasılık, belirsizliğin esnek dilidir ve birçok farklı durumda etkin bir şekilde kullanılabilir. . Temel Olas&#305;l&#305;k Kuram&#305; . Bir zar atalım ve gelen sayının 1 rakamı olma ihtimalini hesaplayalım. Eğer düzgün bir zar ise, 1&#39;den 6&#39;ya kadar olan tüm sonuçlar aynı şansa sahiptir ve dolayısıyla altıda bir oranında 1 rakamı gelir. Daha matematiksel olarak, 1 gelme olasılığının $ frac{1}{6}$ olduğunu söyleriz. . Fabirakadan yeni çıkmış bir zarın düzgün mü değil mi olduğunu öğrenmek isteyebiliriz. Bunu öğrenmenin tek yolu zarı defalarca atmak ve sonuçları kaydetmektir. Her atışta 1 ile 6 arasında bir sonuç elde ederiz. Bu sonuçlardan her bir rakamın olasılığını bulalım. . En basit yol her bir rakamın kaç defa geldiğini saymak ve bunu toplam atış sayısına oranlamaktır. Bu süreç belirlediğimiz olay için (mesela 1 gelmesi olayı) olasığı tahmin etmemizi sağlar. İstatistikteki Büyük Sayılar Yasası gereği, daha çok zar attıkça elde ettiğimiz oranlar gerçek olasılığa doğru yaklaşır. Ayrıntıya girmden önce bir deneme yapalım. . Önce gerekli olan kütüphaneleri yükleyelim. . !pip install d2l==0.13.2 -f https://d2l.ai/whl.html # installing d2l !pip install -U mxnet-cu101mkl==1.6.0 # updating mxnet to at least v1.6 . Şimdi de kullanacağımız araçları ve paket programları çağıralım. . %matplotlib inline from d2l import mxnet as d2l from mxnet import np, npx import random npx.set_np() . Şimdi zar atma işini programla yapmak istiyoruz. İstatistikte buna olasılık dağılımından örneklem alma denir. Belli sayıda seçeneğe karşılık gelen olasılıkları veren dağılıma çokterimli dağılım (multinomial distribution) denir. İleride dağılım kavramı daha net açıklanacaktır ama şimdilik bunu olaylara olasılık eşleme olarak düşünebilirsiniz. . MXNet ile çokterimli dağılımdan örneklem almak için np.random.multinomial fonksiyonunu kullanıyoruz. Bu fonksiyonu farklı şekillerde yükleyip kullanabilirsiniz, biz en kolayını tercih edeceğiz. . Öncelikle np.random.multinomial fonksiyonunun verdiği vektörü ele alalım. Bu vektörün bileşenleri, bu blieşene karşılık gelen sonucun kaç defa elde edildiğini gösterir. Mesela zar atmada, $6$ bileşenli bir vektör vardır ve ilk bileşen $1$ rakamının kaç defa geldiğini, benzer şekilde $i$ bileşeni $i$ sonucunun kaç defa geldiğini gösterir. . Zarı 1 defa atalım. . fair_probs = [1.0 / 6] * 6 np.random.multinomial(1, fair_probs) . array([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], dtype=int64) . Bunu defalarca çalıştırırsanız her seferinde rastgele sonuçlar elde edersiniz. Zarın düzgün olu olmadığını anlamak için bu dağılımdan birçok örneklem almalıyız. Mesela 10 zar atmak için for döngüsü yerine aşağıdakini kullanırız ve birbirinden bağımsız 10 sonucu aynı anda elde etmiş oluruz. . np.random.multinomial(10, fair_probs) . array([1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1], dtype=int64) . Ayrıca bu deneyi örneği aynı anda 3 defa yapabiliriz. . counts = np.random.multinomial(10, fair_probs, size=3) counts . array([[1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0], [3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2]], dtype=int64) . Şimdi zarı 1000 defa atalım ve herbir sonucun gelme oranının bulalım. Bu sayede olasılıkları tahmin etmiş olacağız. . # Sonuçları 32 bit boyutunda ondalıklı bilgisayar sayıları olarak kaydedelim. counts = np.random.multinomial(1000, fair_probs).astype(np.float32) counts / 1000 # Oranlar . array([0.164, 0.153, 0.181, 0.163, 0.163, 0.176]) . Düzgün bir zardan örneklem aldığımız için herbir sonucun gerçek olasılığının $ frac{1}{6}$ veya yaklaşık $0.167$ olduğunu biliyoruz. Dolayısıyla tahminimiz oldukça iyi görünüyor. . Bu tahminlerin örneklem boyutu ve sayısı arttıkça gerçek olasılığa nasıl yaklaştığını görselleştirelim. Örneklem boyutu 10 olan 500 deneyin sonuçlarının gerçek olasılığa nasıl yaklaştığını görelim. . counts = np.random.multinomial(10, fair_probs, size=500) cum_counts = counts.astype(np.float32).cumsum(axis=0) estimates = cum_counts / cum_counts.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True) d2l.set_figsize((6, 4.5)) for i in range(6): d2l.plt.plot(estimates[:, i].asnumpy(), label=(&quot;P(zar=&quot; + str(i + 1) + &quot;)&quot;)) d2l.plt.axhline(y=0.167, color=&#39;black&#39;, linestyle=&#39;dashed&#39;) d2l.plt.gca().set_xlabel(&#39;Deney sayısı&#39;) d2l.plt.gca().set_ylabel(&#39;Olasılık Tahmini&#39;) d2l.plt.legend(); . &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt; Yukarıdaki şekilde sürekli eğriler zarın herbir yüzüne karşılık gelen olasılık tahmininin deney sayısına göre değişimini veriyor. Kesikli çizgi de gerçek olasılığı gösteriyor ve görüldüğü gibi sürekli eğriler buna doğru yaklaşıyor. . Olas&#305;l&#305;k Kuram&#305;n&#305;n Aksiyomlar&#305; . Zar atma ile ilgili çalışırken $ mathcal{S} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }$ kümesine öneklem uzayı, herbir elemana çıktı veya sonuç diyoruz. Bazı sonuçlardan oluşan bir kümeye olay denir. Örneğin $5$ gelmesi yani $ {5 }$ olayı veya tek sayı gelmesi yani $ {1, 3, 5 }$ olayı gibi. Eğer gözlem sonucu $ mathcal{A}$ kümesinde yer alıyorsa bu $ mathcal{A}$ olayı gerçeklşmiş olur. Mesala eğer zar $3$ gelmiş ise, tek sayı gelmesi olayı gerçekleşmiş olur çünkü $3 in {1, 3, 5 }$ sağlanır. . Matematiksel olarak olasılık, kümelere reel sayı karşılık getiren bir fonksiyon olarak tanımlanır. $ mathcal{S}$ örneklem uzayındaki bir $ mathcal{A}$ olayının olasılığı $P( mathcal{A})$ ile gösterilir ve aşağıdaki özellikleri sağlar. . Herhangi bir $ mathcal{A}$ olayının olasılığı negatif olamaz, yani $P( mathcal{A}) geq 0$; | Örneklem uzayının olasılığı $1$ olmalıdır, yani $P( mathcal{S}) = 1$; | Karşılıklı ayrık olan yani $i neq j$ için $ mathcal{A}_i cap mathcal{A}_j = emptyset$ biçimindeki sayılabilir çoklukta $ mathcal{A}_1, mathcal{A}_2, ldots$ olayları için herhangi birisinin gerçekleşmesi olasılığı olasılıklarının toplamına eşittir, yani $P( bigcup_{i=1}^{ infty} mathcal{A}_i) = sum_{i=1}^{ infty} P( mathcal{A}_i)$. | . Bunlara olasılık kuramının aksiyomları denir ve Kolmogorov tarafından 1930&#39;da tanımlanmıştır. Bu sağlam temeller sayesinde rastgelelik ile ilgili felsefi tartışmalardan kurtulup matematiksel araçlarla çalışabilir ve yeni sonuçlar elde edebiliriz. Mesela $ mathcal{A}_1$ olayını örneklem uzayının tamamı ve diğer her $i &gt; 1$ için $ mathcal{A}_i = emptyset$ olarak alırsak, $P( emptyset) = 0$ buluruz, yani boş kümenin olasılığı sıfırdır. . Rassal De&#287;i&#351;kenler . Zar atma deneyinde rassal değişken (random variable) kavramını kullandık. Rassal değişken herhangi bir tür çokluk olabilir ve belirgin (deterministic) değildir. Deneydeki mümkün olan tüm değerleri alabilir. Mesela $X$ rassal değişkeni zar atma deneyindeki $ mathcal{S} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }$ örneklem uzayında değerler alsın. Zarın $5$ gelmesi olayını $ {X = 5 }$ veya $X = 5$ şeklinde olasılığını da $P( {X = 5 })$ veya $P(X = 5)$ ile gösterebiliriz. $P(X = a)$ ile $X$ rassal değişkeni ve onun aldığı $a$ değerini ayrı ayrı belirtmiş oluyoruz. Ancak bu gösterim uzun olacağından, $P(X)$ ile $X$ rassal değişkeninin dağılımını (distribution), $P(a)$ ile de $a$ değerini alma olasılığını göstereceğiz. Benzer şekilde rassal değişkenin belli bir aralıkta değerler alma olasılığını da belirtebiliriz. Örneğin $P(1 leq X leq 3)$ ile $X$ rassal değişkeninin $ {1, 2, 3 }$ değerlerini alma ihtimalini gösteriyoruz. . Zarın üzerindeki rakamlar gibi ayrık rassal değişkenler ile bir insanın boyu gibi sürekli rassal değişkenler arasında önemli bir fark vardır. İki kişinin tam olarak aynı boyda olması pek mümkün değildir. Eğer çok hassas bir uzunluk ölçme aracımız olsaydı, dünyada her kişinin boyunun diğerlerinden farklı olduğunu görürdük. Dolayısıyla bir kişinin boyunun örneğin 1.80139278291028719210196740527486202 metre olma ihtimalini hiçbir zaman sorgulamayız. Dünya nüfusu alındığında bile bu ihtimal sıfırdır. Burada bir kişinin boyunun belirlenen bir aralıkta olma ihtimali anlamlı olur, mesela 1.79 ile 1.81 metre arası gibi. Böyle sürekli rassal değikenlerde herbir değerin yoğunluk (density) olarak olasığı değrlendirilir. Mesela 1.80 metrenin olasılığı sıfırdır ama yoğunluğu sıfırdan büyük bir sayıdır. Bir aralıkta olasılık ise sıfırdan farklı bir değer alabilir. Bu bölümde kesikli rassal değişkenler kullanılacaktır, sürekli rassal değikenlerin olasılığı için Rassal Değişkenler bölümüne bakınız. . Rassal De&#287;i&#351;kenlerin Birbiriyle &#304;li&#351;kileri . Genellikle birden fazla rassal değişkeni bir arada inceleriz. Örneğin Grip ile öksürük gibi belli bir hastalık ile bir belirtinin hastalarda ayrı ayrı ve bir arada görülmesi olasılıkları üzerinden ilişkileri incelenebilir. Bu sayede daha etkin tedavi için çıkarımlar yaılabilir. . Daha karmaşık bir örnek olarak milyonlarca ikselden oluşan resimleri ele alalım. Piksellerin renk değerleri birer rassal değişken olarak görülebilir. Ayrıca resimleri belirten etiketler, yer, konum gibi diğer veriler de birer rassal değişken olarak düşünülebilir. Tüm bu rassal değişkenler bir arada yer alr. Rassal değişkenlerin bir birlerine göre durumlarını incelerken birçok nicelik kullanırız, şimdi bunları görelim. . Ortak Olas&#305;l&#305;k (Joint Probability) . İlkine ortak olasılık denir ve $P(A = a, B=b)$ ile gösterilir. Belli $a$ ve $b$ değerleri için ortak olasılık bize aynı anda $A=a$ ve $B=b$ olması olasılığını verir. Burada her $a$ ve $b$ için $P(A=a, B=b) leq P(A=a)$ olur. Çünkü aynı anda $A=a$ ve $B=b$ olması için ayrı ayrı $A=a$ olmalı ve $B=b$ olmalıdır. Dolayısıyla herbirinin ayrı ayrı olması birlikte olmalarından daha muhtemeldir. . Ko&#351;ullu Olas&#305;l&#305;k (Conditional Probability) . Yukarıdaki eşitsizlikten dolayı $0 leq frac{P(A=a, B=b)}{P(A=a)} leq 1$ elde edilir. Bu orana koşullu olasılık denir ve $P(B=b mid A=a)$ ile gösterilir. Anlamı da, $A=a$ durumunda $B=b$ olması olasılığıdır. . Bayes Teoremi . Koşullu olasılık tanımını kullanarak İstatistiğin en önemli ve gerekli denklemlerinden birisini, yani Bayes Teoremi elde edilebilir. Şöyle ki, tanımdan çarpım kuralı yani $P(A, B) = P(B mid A) P(A)$ elde edilir. $P(A, B)=P(B, A)$ olduğundan aynı zamanda $P(A, B) = P(A mid B) P(B)$ yazılabilir. $P(B) &gt; 0$ kabul edilerek ve sadeleştirmeyle . $$P(A mid B) = frac{P(B mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$ . olur. Yukarıda $P(A, B)$ gösteimi ile belirtilen dağılıma ortak dağılım, $P(A mid B)$ ile gösterilen dağılıma da koşullu dağılım denir. Bu dağılımların özel olarak $A = a, B=b$ için değerleri hesaplanabilir. . Ay&#305;rma (Marginalization) . Bayes Teoremi bir şeyden diğeri için çıkarım yapmada çok yararlıdır. Neden-sonuç ilişkisi gibi durumlarda nasıl kullanılacağını sonraki bölümlerde göreceğiz. Bunun için ayırma işlemine ihtiyacımız var. Bu işlem ile $P(A, B)$ yardımıyla $P(B)$ elde edilmektedir. $B$ rassal değişkeninin olasılığı, $A$ rassal değişkeninin alabileceği her değer için ortak olasılıkların toplamıdır. Buna toplam kuralı denir ve . $$P(B) = sum_{A} P(A, B)$$ . biçiminde formülleştirilir. Ayırma sonucunda elde edilen olasılığa ya da bunun dağılımına marjinal olasılık ya da marjinal dağılım denir. . Ba&#287;&#305;ms&#305;zl&#305;k (Independence) . Rassal değişkenler arasında bakılan bir diğer özellik de bağımlılık ya da tersi bağımsızlık durumudur. $A$ ve $B$ gibi iki rassal değişkenin bağımsız olması, $B$ rassal değişkeninin aldığı değerlerin $A$ için herhangi bir bilgi ortaya koymaması olarak özetlenebilir. Bu durumda $P(B mid A) = P(B)$ olur. İstatistikçiler bağımsızlığı $A perp B$ ile gösterir. Bayes Toeremi gereği P(A mid B) = P(A)$ elde edilir. Diğer hallerde $A$ ve $B$ bağımlıdır. Örneğin iki zarın arka arkaya atılması bağımsız rassal değişkenler verir. Bununla birlikte bir odadaki elektrik düğmesi ile odanın aydınlık olması bağımlıdır. (Elektrik düğmesinin açık olması aydınlık olacağını kesin gerektirmez çünkü düğme bozu olabilir ya da elektrikler kesilebilir.) . $P(A mid B) = frac{P(A, B)}{P(B)} = P(A)$ eşitliğiyle ile $P(A, B) = P(A)P(B)$ eşitliği birbirine denk olduğundan, iki rassal değişkenin bağımsız olması ortak dağılımın bunların dağılımlarının çarpımına eşit olması ile aynı şeydir. Benzer şekilde $A$ ve $B$ rassal değişkenleri $C$ rassal değikenine göre koşullu bağımsızlık tanımı $P(A, B mid C) = P(A mid C)P(B mid C)$ olarak verilebilir ve $A perp B mid C$ biçiminde gösterilir. . Uygulamalar . Şimdi öğrendiklerimizi sınayalım. Bir doktor kendisine başvuran bir kişiye AIDS testi uyguluyor. Bu test oldukça güvenilir ve sağlam bir kişiyi AIDS hastası göstermesi olasılığı %1. Hatta HIV virüsü taşıyan bir kişiyi tesit etmede kesinlikle hata yapmıyor. $D_1$ ile teşhisi gösterirelim, yani pozitif teşhis için $1$, negatif teşhis için $0$ değerini alsın. $H$ ile de HIV virüsü taşımayı gösterelim, dolayısıyla HIV pozitif için $1$, HIV negatif için $0$ değeri alsın. Aşağıdaki tablo eldeki verileri özetler. . Koşullu Olasılık $H=1$ $H=0$ . $P(D_1 = 1 mid H)$ | 1 | 0.01 | . $P(D_1 = 0 mid H)$ | 0 | 0.99 | . Tablodaki sütunların toplamı 1 olmalıdır çünkü koşullu olasılık da bir olasılık dağılımıdır. Doktora başvuran kişinin testi pozitif çıkıyor, bu durumda kişinin AIDS olma olasılığını inceleyelim. Yani $P(H = 1 mid D_1 = 1)$ değerini hesaplamak istiyoruz. Bu oran hastalığın toplumda ne kadar yaygın olduğuna bağlıdır, çünkü yanlış alarm oranını buradan elde ederiz. Toplumun oldukça sağlıklı olduğunu örneğin $P(H=1) = 0.0015$ olduğunu kabul edelim. Bayes Teoremi&#39;ni uygulamadan önce ayırma ve çarım kuralı ile aşağıdaki hesabı yapalım: . $$ begin{aligned} &amp;P(D_1 = 1) =&amp; P(D_1=1, H=0) + P(D_1=1, H=1) =&amp; P(D_1=1 mid H=0) P(H=0) + P(D_1=1 mid H=1) P(H=1) =&amp; 0.011485. end{aligned} $$Dolayısıyla . $$ begin{aligned} &amp;P(H = 1 mid D_1 = 1) =&amp; frac{P(D_1=1 mid H=1) P(H=1)}{P(D_1=1)} =&amp; 0.1306 end{aligned}$$elde edilir. Diğer bir ifadeyle kişinin gerçekten AIDS olma olasılığı sadece %13.06 olarak bulunur. Test oldukça güvenilirdi ama oran düşük çıktı. Olasılık bazen sezgilere aykırı olabiliyor. . Kişi testi pozitif çıkınca ne yapmalıdır? Büyük ihtimalle farklı bir test daha uygulanacaktır. İkinci test biraz farklı özellikte ve ikincisi kadar iyi değil. Tabloda özelliklerini görelim. . Koşullu Olasılık $H=1$ $H=0$ . $P(D_2 = 1 mid H)$ | 0.98 | 0.03 | . $P(D_2 = 0 mid H)$ | 0.02 | 0.97 | . Maalesef ikinci test sonucu da pozitif çıkıyor. İki tstin koşullu olarak bağımsız olduğunu düşünerek Bayes Teoreni&#39;ni uygulayalım: . $$ begin{aligned} &amp;P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 mid H = 0) =&amp; P(D_1 = 1 mid H = 0) P(D_2 = 1 mid H = 0) =&amp; 0.0003, end{aligned} $$$$ begin{aligned} &amp;P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 mid H = 1) =&amp; P(D_1 = 1 mid H = 1) P(D_2 = 1 mid H = 1) =&amp; 0.98. end{aligned} $$Şimdi ayırma ve çarpım kuralını uygulayabiliriz: . $$ begin{aligned} &amp;P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1) =&amp; P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1, H = 0) + P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1, H = 1) =&amp; P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 mid H = 0)P(H=0) + P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 mid H = 1)P(H=1) =&amp; 0.00176955. end{aligned} $$Sonuç olarak kişinin AIDS olma olasılğı hesalanırsa . $$ begin{aligned} &amp;P(H = 1 mid D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1) =&amp; frac{P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 mid H=1) P(H=1)}{P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1)} =&amp; 0.8307 end{aligned} $$elde edilir. Yani ikinci test çok daha emin olmamızı sağladı. İkinci test birincisine göre oldukça az güvenilirdi ama tahminimizi önemli ölçüde geliştirdi. . Beklenen De&#287;er ve Varyans (Expectation and Variance) . Olasılık dağılımlarının belirgin özelliklerini özetlemek için bazı ölçümlere ihtiyaç vardır. Bir $X$ rassal değişkeni için beklenen değer (ya da ortalama), . $$E[X] = sum_{x} x P(X = x)$$ . şeklinde gösterilir ve tanımlanır. Eğer bir $f(x)$ fonksiyonunun girdileri $P$ dağılımına sahip bir rassal değişkende geliyorsa bu fonksiyonun beklenen değeri . $$E_{x sim P}[f(x)] = sum_x f(x) P(x)$$ . olarak tanımlanır. . Genellikle $X$ rassal değişkeninin ortalamadan ne kadar satığını bilmek isteriz. Bunu aşağıda tanımlanan varyans ile yaparız: . $$ mathrm{Var}[X] = E left[(X - E[X])^2 right] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2.$$Varyansın karekökü standart sapma olarak adlandırılır. Rassal değişkenin bir fonksiyonu için varyans benzer şekilde tanımlanır ve dağılımdan farklı $x$ örneklemleri alındığında fonksiyonun ortalamasından ne kadar saptığını gösterir: . $$ mathrm{Var}[f(x)] = E left[ left(f(x) - E[f(x)] right)^2 right].$$ . &#214;zet . Olasılık dağılımında örneklem alabiliriz. | Birçok rassal değişkeni ortak dağılım, koşullu dağılım, Bayes Kuralı, ayırma ve bağımsızlık kavramları yardımıyla bir arada analiz edebiliriz. | Ortalama ve varyans olasılık dağılımının belirgin özelliklerini özetlemek için yararlı araçlardır. | . Al&#305;&#351;t&#305;rmalar . Deneyimizde $n=10$ boyutunda örneklem için $m=500$ grup aldık. Siz de $m$ ve $n$ için farklı değerler alarak inceleme yapın. | $P( mathcal{A})$ ve $P( mathcal{B})$ olasılıklarına sahip olayları göz önüne alarak $P( mathcal{A} cup mathcal{B})$ ve $P( mathcal{A} cap mathcal{B})$ olasılıkları için alt ve üst sınırlar belirleyin. (Venn Şeması ile görebilirsiniz.) | $A$, $B$, ve $C$ gibi üç rassal değişkenimiz var. $B$ sadece $A$ ile bağımlı ve $C$ sadece $B$ ile bağımlı. $P(A, B, C)$ olasılığını nasıl sadeleştirirsiniz? (Bu bir Markov Zinciri&#39;dir.) | Uygulamamızda ilk test daha güvenilirdi. Neden ilk testi ikinci kez tekrarlamak iyi bir fikir değildir? | Discussions .",

            "content": "De&#287;i&#351;kenler . Variables are containers for holding data and they&#39;re defined by a name and value. . # Integer variable x = 5 print (x) print (type(x)) . 5 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; . We can change the value of a variable by simply assigning a new value to it. . # String variable x = &quot;hello&quot; print (x) print (type(x)) . hello &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . There are many different types of variables: integers, floats, strings, boolean etc. . # int variable x = 5 print (x, type(x)) . 5 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; . # float variable x = 5.0 print (x, type(x)) . 5.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; . # text variable x = &quot;5&quot; print (x, type(x)) . 5 &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . # boolean variable x = True print (x, type(x)) . True &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; . We can also do operations with variables. . # Variables can be used with each other a = 1 b = 2 c = a + b print (c) . 3 . We should always know what types of variables we&#39;re dealing with so we can do the right operations with them. Here&#39;s a common mistake that can happen if we&#39;re using the wrong variable type. . # int variables a = 5 b = 3 print (a + b) . 8 . # string variables a = &quot;5&quot; b = &quot;3&quot; print (a + b) . 53 . Lists . Lists are an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of values that are comma separated and enclosed by square brackets. A list can be comprised of many different types of variables (below is a list with an integer, string and a float). . # Creating a list x = [3, &quot;hello&quot;, 1.2] print (x) . [3, &#39;hello&#39;, 1.2] . # Length of a list len(x) . 3 . You can add to a list by using the append function. . # Adding to a list x.append(7) print (x) print (len(x)) . [3, &#39;hello&#39;, 1.2, 7] 4 . # Replacing items in a list x[1] = &quot;bye&quot; print (x) . [3, &#39;bye&#39;, 1.2, 7] . # Operations y = [2.4, &quot;world&quot;] z = x + y print (z) . [3, &#39;bye&#39;, 1.2, 7, 2.4, &#39;world&#39;] . Indexing and Slicing . Indexing and slicing from lists allow us to retrieve specific values within lists. Note that indices can be positive (starting from 0) or negative (-1 and lower, where -1 is the last item in the list). . # Indexing x = [3, &quot;hello&quot;, 1.2] print (&quot;x[0]: &quot;, x[0]) print (&quot;x[1]: &quot;, x[1]) print (&quot;x[-1]: &quot;, x[-1]) # the last item print (&quot;x[-2]: &quot;, x[-2]) # the second to last item . x[0]: 3 x[1]: hello x[-1]: 1.2 x[-2]: hello . # Slicing print (&quot;x[:]: &quot;, x[:]) # all indices print (&quot;x[1:]: &quot;, x[1:]) # index 1 to the end of the list print (&quot;x[1:2]: &quot;, x[1:2]) # index 1 to index 2 (not including index 2) print (&quot;x[:-1]: &quot;, x[:-1]) # index 0 to last index (not including last index) . x[:]: [3, &#39;hello&#39;, 1.2] x[1:]: [&#39;hello&#39;, 1.2] x[1:2]: [&#39;hello&#39;] x[:-1]: [3, &#39;hello&#39;] . Tuples . Tuples are collections that are ordered and immutable (unchangeable). You will use these to store values that will never be changed. . # Creating a tuple x = (3.0, &quot;hello&quot;) # tuples start and end with () print (x) . (3.0, &#39;hello&#39;) . # Adding values to a tuple x = x + (5.6, 4) print (x) . (3.0, &#39;hello&#39;, 5.6, 4) . # Try to change (it won&#39;t work and you&#39;ll get an error) x[0] = 1.2 . TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-19-d0da6f639f74&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() -&gt; 1 x[0] = 1.2 TypeError: &#39;tuple&#39; object does not support item assignment . Dictionaries . Dictionaries are an unordered, mutable and indexed collection of key-value pairs. You can retrieve values based on the key and a dictionary cannot have two of the same keys. . # Creating a dictionary person = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Goku&#39;, &#39;eye_color&#39;: &#39;brown&#39;} print (person) print (person[&#39;name&#39;]) print (person[&#39;eye_color&#39;]) . {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Goku&#39;, &#39;eye_color&#39;: &#39;brown&#39;} Goku brown . # Changing the value for a key person[&#39;eye_color&#39;] = &#39;green&#39; print (person) . {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Goku&#39;, &#39;eye_color&#39;: &#39;green&#39;} . # Adding new key-value pairs person[&#39;age&#39;] = 24 print (person) . {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Goku&#39;, &#39;eye_color&#39;: &#39;green&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 24} . # Length of a dictionary print (len(person)) . 3 . If statements . We can use if statements to conditionally do something. The conditions are defined by the words if, elif (which stands for else if) and else. We can have as many elif statements as we want. The indented code below each condition is the code that will execute if the condition is True. . # If statement x = 4 if x &lt; 1: score = &#39;low&#39; elif x &lt;= 4: # elif = else if score = &#39;medium&#39; else: score = &#39;high&#39; print (score) . medium . # If statement with a boolean x = True if x: print (&quot;it worked&quot;) . it worked . Loops . For Loops . A for loop can iterate over a collection of values (lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.) The indented code is executed for each item in the collection of values. . # For loop veggies = [&quot;carrots&quot;, &quot;broccoli&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;] for veggie in veggies: print (veggie) . carrots broccoli beans . When the loop encounters the break command, the loop will terminate immediately. If there were more items in the list, they will not be processed. . # `break` from a for loop veggies = [&quot;carrots&quot;, &quot;broccoli&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;] for veggie in veggies: if veggie == &quot;broccoli&quot;: break print (veggie) . carrots . When the loop encounters the continue command, the loop will skip all other operations for that item in the list only. If there were more items in the list, the loop will continue normally. . # `continue` to the next iteration veggies = [&quot;carrots&quot;, &quot;broccoli&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;] for veggie in veggies: if veggie == &quot;broccoli&quot;: continue print (veggie) . carrots beans . While Loops . A while loop can perform repeatedly as long as a condition is True. We can use continue and break commands in while loops as well. . # While loop x = 3 while x &gt; 0: x -= 1 # same as x = x - 1 print (x) . 2 1 0 . Functions . Functions are a way to modularize reusable pieces of code. They&#39;re defined by the keyword def which stands for definition and they can have the following components. . # Define the function def add_two(x): &quot;&quot;&quot;Increase x by 2.&quot;&quot;&quot; # explains what this function will do x += 2 return x . Here are the components that may be required when we want to use the function. we need to ensure that the function name and the input parameters match with how we defined the function above. . # Use the function score = 0 new_score = add_two(x=score) print (new_score) . 2 . A function can have as many input parameters and outputs as we want. . # Function with multiple inputs def join_name(first_name, last_name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Combine first name and last name.&quot;&quot;&quot; joined_name = first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name return joined_name . # Use the function first_name = &quot;Goku&quot; last_name = &quot;Mohandas&quot; joined_name = join_name(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name) print (joined_name) . Goku Mohandas . NOTE: It&#39;s good practice to always use keyword argument when using a function so that it&#39;s very clear what input variable belongs to what function input parameter. On a related note, you will often see the terms *args and **kwargs which stand for arguments and keyword arguments. You can extract them when they are passed into a function. The significance of the * is that any number of arguments and keyword arguments can be passed into the function. . def f(*args, **kwargs): x = args[0] y = kwargs.get(&#39;y&#39;) print (f&quot;x: {x}, y: {y}&quot;) . f(5, y=2) . x: 5, y: 2 . Classes . Classes are object constructors and are a fundamental component of object oriented programming in Python. They are composed of a set of functions that define the class and it&#39;s operations. . __init__() function . The init function is used when an instance of the class is initialized. . # Creating the class class Pet(object): &quot;&quot;&quot;Class object for a pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, species, name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialize a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.species = species self.name = name . # Creating an instance of a class my_dog = Pet(species=&quot;dog&quot;, name=&quot;Scooby&quot;) print (my_dog) print (my_dog.name) . &lt;__main__.Pet object at 0x7fe487e9c358&gt; Scooby . __str()__ function . The print (my_dog) command printed something not so relevant to us. Let&#39;s fix that with the __str()__ function. . # Creating the class class Pet(object): &quot;&quot;&quot;Class object for a pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, species, name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialize a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.species = species self.name = name def __str__(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Output when printing an instance of a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; return f&quot;{self.species} named {self.name}&quot; . # Creating an instance of a class my_dog = Pet(species=&quot;dog&quot;, name=&quot;Scooby&quot;) print (my_dog) print (my_dog.name) . dog named Scooby Scooby . NOTE: Classes can be customized with magic functions like, __str__, to enable powerful operations. We&#39;ll be exploring additional built-in functions in subsequent notebooks (like __iter__ and __getitem__) but if you&#39;re curious, here is a tutorial on more magic methods. . Object methods . # Creating the class class Pet(object): &quot;&quot;&quot;Class object for a pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, species, name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialize a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.species = species self.name = name def __str__(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Output when printing an instance of a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; return f&quot;{self.species} named {self.name}&quot; def change_name(self, new_name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Change the name of your Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.name = new_name . # Creating an instance of a class my_dog = Pet(species=&quot;dog&quot;, name=&quot;Scooby&quot;) print (my_dog) print (my_dog.name) . dog named Scooby Scooby . # Using a class&#39;s function my_dog.change_name(new_name=&quot;Scrappy&quot;) print (my_dog) print (my_dog.name) . dog named Scrappy Scrappy . Inheritance . Inheritance allows you to inherit all the properties and methods from another class (the parent). Notice how we inherited the initialized variables from the parent Pet class like species and name. We also inherited the change_name function. But for the __str__ function, we define our own version to overwrite the Pet class&#39; __str__ function. . class Dog(Pet): def __init__(self, species, name, breed): super().__init__(&quot;dog&quot;, name) self.breed = breed def __str__(self): return f&quot;{self.breed} named {self.name}&quot; . scooby = Dog(species=&quot;dog&quot;, breed=&quot;Great Dane&quot;, name=&quot;Scooby&quot;) print (scooby) . Great Dane named Scooby . scooby.change_name(&#39;Scooby Doo&#39;) print (scooby) . Great Dane named Scooby Doo . Decorators . Recall that functions allow us to modularize code and reuse them. However, we&#39;ll often want to add some functionality before or after the main function executes and we may want to do this for many different functions. Instead of adding more code to the original function, we can use decorators! . decorators: augment a function with pre/post-processing. Decorators wrap around the main function and allow us to operate on the inputs and or outputs. | . Suppose we have a function called operations which increments the input value x by 1. . def operations(x): &quot;&quot;&quot;Basic operations.&quot;&quot;&quot; x += 1 return x . operations(x=1) . 2 . Now let&#39;s say we want to increment our input x by 1 before and after the operations function executes and, to illustrate this example, let&#39;s say the increments have to be separate steps. Here&#39;s how we would do it by changing the original code: . def operations(x): &quot;&quot;&quot;Basic operations.&quot;&quot;&quot; x += 1 x += 1 x += 1 return x . operations(x=1) . 4 . We were able to achieve what we want but we now increased the size of our operations function and if we want to do the same incrementation for any other function, we have to add the same code to all of those as well ... not very efficient. To solve this, let&#39;s create a decorator called add which increments x by 1 before and after the main function f executes. . Creating a decorator function . The decorator function accepts a function f which is the function we wish to wrap around (in our case, it&#39;s operations). The output of the decorator is its wrapper function which receives the arguments and keyword arguments passed to function f. . Inside the wrapper function, we can extract the input parameters [line 5] passed to function f and make any changes we want [line 6]. Then the function f is executed [line 7] and then we can make changes to the outputs as well [line 8]. Finally, the wrapper function will return some value(s) [line 9] which is what the decorator returns as well since it returns wrapper. . # Decorator def add(f): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): &quot;&quot;&quot;Wrapper function for @add.&quot;&quot;&quot; x = kwargs.pop(&#39;x&#39;) # .get() if not altering x x += 1 # executes before function f x = f(*args, **kwargs, x=x) x += 1 # executes after function f return x return wrapper . We can use this decorator by simply adding it to the top of our main function preceded by the @ symbol. . @add def operations(x): &quot;&quot;&quot;Basic operations.&quot;&quot;&quot; x += 1 return x . operations(x=1) . 4 . Suppose we wanted to debug and see what function actually executed with operations. . operations.__name__, operations.__doc__ . (&#39;wrapper&#39;, &#39;Wrapper function for @add.&#39;) . The function name and docstring are not what we&#39;re looking for but it appears this way because the wrapper function is what was executed. In order to fix this, Python offers functools.wraps which carries the main function&#39;s metadata. . from functools import wraps . # Decorator def add(f): @wraps(f) def wrap(*args, **kwargs): &quot;&quot;&quot;Wrapper function for @add.&quot;&quot;&quot; x = kwargs.pop(&#39;x&#39;) x += 1 x = f(*args, **kwargs, x=x) x += 1 return x return wrap . @add def operations(x): &quot;&quot;&quot;Basic operations.&quot;&quot;&quot; x += 1 return x . operations.__name__, operations.__doc__ . (&#39;operations&#39;, &#39;Basic operations.&#39;) . Awesome! We were able to decorate our main function operation to achieve the customization we wanted without actually altering the function. We can reuse our decorator for other functions that may need the same customization! . This was a dummy example to show how decorators work but we&#39;ll be using them heavily during our production ML lessons. A simple scenario would be using decorators to create uniform JSON responses from each API endpoint without including the bulky code in each endpoint. . Callbacks . Decorators allow for customized operations before and after the main function&#39;s execution but what about in between? Suppose we want to conditionally/situationally do some operations. Instead of writing a whole bunch of if-statements and make our functions bulky, we can use callbacks! . callbacks: conditional/situational processing within the function. | . Our callbacks will be classes that have functions with key names that will execute at various periods during the main function&#39;s execution. The function names are up to us but we need to invoke the same callback functions within our main function. . # Callback class x_tracker(object): def __init__(self, x): self.history = [] def at_start(self, x): self.history.append(x) def at_end(self, x): self.history.append(x) . We can pass in as many callbacks as we want and because they have appropriately named functions, they will be invoked at the appropriate times. . def operations(x, callbacks=[]): &quot;&quot;&quot;Basic operations.&quot;&quot;&quot; for callback in callbacks: callback.at_start(x) x += 1 for callback in callbacks: callback.at_end(x) return x . x = 1 tracker = x_tracker(x=x) operations(x=x, callbacks=[tracker]) . 2 . tracker.history . [1, 2] . Putting it all together . decorators + callbacks = powerful customization before, during and after the main function’s execution without increasing its complexity. We will be using this duo to create powerful ML training scripts that are highly customizable in future lessons. . from functools import wraps . # Decorator def add(f): @wraps(f) def wrap(*args, **kwargs): &quot;&quot;&quot;Wrapper function for @add.&quot;&quot;&quot; x = kwargs.pop(&#39;x&#39;) # .get() if not altering x x += 1 # executes before function f x = f(*args, **kwargs, x=x) # can do things post function f as well return x return wrap . # Callback class x_tracker(object): def __init__(self, x): self.history = [x] def at_start(self, x): self.history.append(x) def at_end(self, x): self.history.append(x) . # Main function @add def operations(x, callbacks=[]): &quot;&quot;&quot;Basic operations.&quot;&quot;&quot; for callback in callbacks: callback.at_start(x) x += 1 for callback in callbacks: callback.at_end(x) return x . x = 1 tracker = x_tracker(x=x) operations(x=x, callbacks=[tracker]) . 3 . tracker.history .

            "content": "De&#287;i&#351;kenler . Variables are containers for holding data and they&#39;re defined by a name and value. . # Integer variable x = 5 print (x) print (type(x)) . 5 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; . We can change the value of a variable by simply assigning a new value to it. . # String variable x = &quot;hello&quot; print (x) print (type(x)) . hello &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . There are many different types of variables: integers, floats, strings, boolean etc. . # int variable x = 5 print (x, type(x)) . 5 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; . # float variable x = 5.0 print (x, type(x)) . 5.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; . # text variable x = &quot;5&quot; print (x, type(x)) . 5 &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . # boolean variable x = True print (x, type(x)) . True &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; . We can also do operations with variables. . # Variables can be used with each other a = 1 b = 2 c = a + b print (c) . 3 . We should always know what types of variables we&#39;re dealing with so we can do the right operations with them. Here&#39;s a common mistake that can happen if we&#39;re using the wrong variable type. . # int variables a = 5 b = 3 print (a + b) . 8 . # string variables a = &quot;5&quot; b = &quot;3&quot; print (a + b) . 53 . Lists . Lists are an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of values that are comma separated and enclosed by square brackets. A list can be comprised of many different types of variables (below is a list with an integer, string and a float). . # Creating a list x = [3, &quot;hello&quot;, 1.2] print (x) . [3, &#39;hello&#39;, 1.2] . # Length of a list len(x) . 3 . You can add to a list by using the append function. . # Adding to a list x.append(7) print (x) print (len(x)) . [3, &#39;hello&#39;, 1.2, 7] 4 . # Replacing items in a list x[1] = &quot;bye&quot; print (x) . [3, &#39;bye&#39;, 1.2, 7] . # Operations y = [2.4, &quot;world&quot;] z = x + y print (z) . [3, &#39;bye&#39;, 1.2, 7, 2.4, &#39;world&#39;] . Indexing and Slicing . Indexing and slicing from lists allow us to retrieve specific values within lists. Note that indices can be positive (starting from 0) or negative (-1 and lower, where -1 is the last item in the list). . # Indexing x = [3, &quot;hello&quot;, 1.2] print (&quot;x[0]: &quot;, x[0]) print (&quot;x[1]: &quot;, x[1]) print (&quot;x[-1]: &quot;, x[-1]) # the last item print (&quot;x[-2]: &quot;, x[-2]) # the second to last item . x[0]: 3 x[1]: hello x[-1]: 1.2 x[-2]: hello . # Slicing print (&quot;x[:]: &quot;, x[:]) # all indices print (&quot;x[1:]: &quot;, x[1:]) # index 1 to the end of the list print (&quot;x[1:2]: &quot;, x[1:2]) # index 1 to index 2 (not including index 2) print (&quot;x[:-1]: &quot;, x[:-1]) # index 0 to last index (not including last index) . x[:]: [3, &#39;hello&#39;, 1.2] x[1:]: [&#39;hello&#39;, 1.2] x[1:2]: [&#39;hello&#39;] x[:-1]: [3, &#39;hello&#39;] . Tuples . Tuples are collections that are ordered and immutable (unchangeable). You will use these to store values that will never be changed. . # Creating a tuple x = (3.0, &quot;hello&quot;) # tuples start and end with () print (x) . (3.0, &#39;hello&#39;) . # Adding values to a tuple x = x + (5.6, 4) print (x) . (3.0, &#39;hello&#39;, 5.6, 4) . # Try to change (it won&#39;t work and you&#39;ll get an error) x[0] = 1.2 . TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-19-d0da6f639f74&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() -&gt; 1 x[0] = 1.2 TypeError: &#39;tuple&#39; object does not support item assignment . Dictionaries . Dictionaries are an unordered, mutable and indexed collection of key-value pairs. You can retrieve values based on the key and a dictionary cannot have two of the same keys. . # Creating a dictionary person = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Goku&#39;, &#39;eye_color&#39;: &#39;brown&#39;} print (person) print (person[&#39;name&#39;]) print (person[&#39;eye_color&#39;]) . {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Goku&#39;, &#39;eye_color&#39;: &#39;brown&#39;} Goku brown . # Changing the value for a key person[&#39;eye_color&#39;] = &#39;green&#39; print (person) . {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Goku&#39;, &#39;eye_color&#39;: &#39;green&#39;} . # Adding new key-value pairs person[&#39;age&#39;] = 24 print (person) . {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Goku&#39;, &#39;eye_color&#39;: &#39;green&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 24} . # Length of a dictionary print (len(person)) . 3 . If statements . We can use if statements to conditionally do something. The conditions are defined by the words if, elif (which stands for else if) and else. We can have as many elif statements as we want. The indented code below each condition is the code that will execute if the condition is True. . # If statement x = 4 if x &lt; 1: score = &#39;low&#39; elif x &lt;= 4: # elif = else if score = &#39;medium&#39; else: score = &#39;high&#39; print (score) . medium . # If statement with a boolean x = True if x: print (&quot;it worked&quot;) . it worked . Loops . For Loops . A for loop can iterate over a collection of values (lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.) The indented code is executed for each item in the collection of values. . # For loop veggies = [&quot;carrots&quot;, &quot;broccoli&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;] for veggie in veggies: print (veggie) . carrots broccoli beans . When the loop encounters the break command, the loop will terminate immediately. If there were more items in the list, they will not be processed. . # `break` from a for loop veggies = [&quot;carrots&quot;, &quot;broccoli&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;] for veggie in veggies: if veggie == &quot;broccoli&quot;: break print (veggie) . carrots . When the loop encounters the continue command, the loop will skip all other operations for that item in the list only. If there were more items in the list, the loop will continue normally. . # `continue` to the next iteration veggies = [&quot;carrots&quot;, &quot;broccoli&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;] for veggie in veggies: if veggie == &quot;broccoli&quot;: continue print (veggie) . carrots beans . While Loops . A while loop can perform repeatedly as long as a condition is True. We can use continue and break commands in while loops as well. . # While loop x = 3 while x &gt; 0: x -= 1 # same as x = x - 1 print (x) . 2 1 0 . Functions . Functions are a way to modularize reusable pieces of code. They&#39;re defined by the keyword def which stands for definition and they can have the following components. . # Define the function def add_two(x): &quot;&quot;&quot;Increase x by 2.&quot;&quot;&quot; # explains what this function will do x += 2 return x . Here are the components that may be required when we want to use the function. we need to ensure that the function name and the input parameters match with how we defined the function above. . # Use the function score = 0 new_score = add_two(x=score) print (new_score) . 2 . A function can have as many input parameters and outputs as we want. . # Function with multiple inputs def join_name(first_name, last_name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Combine first name and last name.&quot;&quot;&quot; joined_name = first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name return joined_name . # Use the function first_name = &quot;Goku&quot; last_name = &quot;Mohandas&quot; joined_name = join_name(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name) print (joined_name) . Goku Mohandas . NOTE: It&#39;s good practice to always use keyword argument when using a function so that it&#39;s very clear what input variable belongs to what function input parameter. On a related note, you will often see the terms *args and **kwargs which stand for arguments and keyword arguments. You can extract them when they are passed into a function. The significance of the * is that any number of arguments and keyword arguments can be passed into the function. . def f(*args, **kwargs): x = args[0] y = kwargs.get(&#39;y&#39;) print (f&quot;x: {x}, y: {y}&quot;) . f(5, y=2) . x: 5, y: 2 . Classes . Classes are object constructors and are a fundamental component of object oriented programming in Python. They are composed of a set of functions that define the class and it&#39;s operations. . __init__() function . The init function is used when an instance of the class is initialized. . # Creating the class class Pet(object): &quot;&quot;&quot;Class object for a pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, species, name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialize a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.species = species self.name = name . # Creating an instance of a class my_dog = Pet(species=&quot;dog&quot;, name=&quot;Scooby&quot;) print (my_dog) print (my_dog.name) . &lt;__main__.Pet object at 0x7fe487e9c358&gt; Scooby . __str()__ function . The print (my_dog) command printed something not so relevant to us. Let&#39;s fix that with the __str()__ function. . # Creating the class class Pet(object): &quot;&quot;&quot;Class object for a pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, species, name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialize a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.species = species self.name = name def __str__(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Output when printing an instance of a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; return f&quot;{self.species} named {self.name}&quot; . # Creating an instance of a class my_dog = Pet(species=&quot;dog&quot;, name=&quot;Scooby&quot;) print (my_dog) print (my_dog.name) . dog named Scooby Scooby . NOTE: Classes can be customized with magic functions like, __str__, to enable powerful operations. We&#39;ll be exploring additional built-in functions in subsequent notebooks (like __iter__ and __getitem__) but if you&#39;re curious, here is a tutorial on more magic methods. . Object methods . # Creating the class class Pet(object): &quot;&quot;&quot;Class object for a pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, species, name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialize a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.species = species self.name = name def __str__(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Output when printing an instance of a Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; return f&quot;{self.species} named {self.name}&quot; def change_name(self, new_name): &quot;&quot;&quot;Change the name of your Pet.&quot;&quot;&quot; self.name = new_name . # Creating an instance of a class my_dog = Pet(species=&quot;dog&quot;, name=&quot;Scooby&quot;) print (my_dog) print (my_dog.name) . dog named Scooby Scooby . # Using a class&#39;s function my_dog.change_name(new_name=&quot;Scrappy&quot;) print (my_dog) print (my_dog.name) . dog named Scrappy Scrappy . Inheritance . Inheritance allows you to inherit all the properties and methods from another class (the parent). Notice how we inherited the initialized variables from the parent Pet class like species and name. We also inherited the change_name function. But for the __str__ function, we define our own version to overwrite the Pet class&#39; __str__ function. . class Dog(Pet): def __init__(self, species, name, breed): super().__init__(&quot;dog&quot;, name) self.breed = breed def __str__(self): return f&quot;{self.breed} named {self.name}&quot; . scooby = Dog(species=&quot;dog&quot;, breed=&quot;Great Dane&quot;, name=&quot;Scooby&quot;) print (scooby) . Great Dane named Scooby . scooby.change_name(&#39;Scooby Doo&#39;) print (scooby) . Great Dane named Scooby Doo . Decorators . Recall that functions allow us to modularize code and reuse them. However, we&#39;ll often want to add some functionality before or after the main function executes and we may want to do this for many different functions. Instead of adding more code to the original function, we can use decorators! . decorators: augment a function with pre/post-processing.

NumPy also comes with several functions that allow us to create tensors quickly. . # Functions print (&quot;np.zeros((2,2)): n&quot;, np.zeros((2,2))) print (&quot;np.ones((2,2)): n&quot;, np.ones((2,2))) print (&quot;np.eye((2)): n&quot;, np.eye((2))) # identity matrix print (&quot;np.random.random((2,2)): n&quot;, np.random.random((2,2))) . np.zeros((2,2)): [[0. 0.] [0. 0.]] np.ones((2,2)): [[1. 1.] [1. 1.]] np.eye((2)): [[1. 0.] [0. 1.]] np.random.random((2,2)): [[0.19151945 0.62210877] [0.43772774 0.78535858]] . Indexing . Keep in mind that when indexing the row and column, indices start at 0. And like indexing with lists, we can use negative indices as well (where -1 is the last item). . # Indexing x = np.array([1, 2, 3]) print (&quot;x: &quot;, x) print (&quot;x[0]: &quot;, x[0]) x[0] = 0 print (&quot;x: &quot;, x) . x: [1 2 3] x[0]: 1 x: [0 2 3] . # Slicing x = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]]) print (x) print (&quot;x column 1: &quot;, x[:, 1]) print (&quot;x row 0: &quot;, x[0, :]) print (&quot;x rows 0,1 &amp; cols 1,2: n&quot;, x[0:2, 1:3]) . [[ 1 2 3 4] [ 5 6 7 8] [ 9 10 11 12]] x column 1: [ 2 6 10] x row 0: [1 2 3 4] x rows 0,1 &amp; cols 1,2: [[2 3] [6 7]] . # Integer array indexing print (x) rows_to_get = np.array([0, 1, 2]) print (&quot;rows_to_get: &quot;, rows_to_get) cols_to_get = np.array([0, 2, 1]) print (&quot;cols_to_get: &quot;, cols_to_get) # Combine sequences above to get values to get print (&quot;indexed values: &quot;, x[rows_to_get, cols_to_get]) # (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1) . [[ 1 2 3 4] [ 5 6 7 8] [ 9 10 11 12]] rows_to_get: [0 1 2] cols_to_get: [0 2 1] indexed values: [ 1 7 10] . # Boolean array indexing x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) print (&quot;x: n&quot;, x) print (&quot;x &gt; 2: n&quot;, x &gt; 2) print (&quot;x[x &gt; 2]: n&quot;, x[x &gt; 2]) . x: [[1 2] [3 4] [5 6]] x &gt; 2: [[False False] [ True True] [ True True]] x[x &gt; 2]: [3 4 5 6] . Arithmetic . # Basic math x = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]], dtype=np.float64) y = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]], dtype=np.float64) print (&quot;x + y: n&quot;, np.add(x, y)) # or x + y print (&quot;x - y: n&quot;, np.subtract(x, y)) # or x - y print (&quot;x * y: n&quot;, np.multiply(x, y)) # or x * y . x + y: [[2. 4.] [6. 8.]] x - y: [[0. 0.] [0. 0.]] x * y: [[ 1. 4.] [ 9. 16.]] . Dot product . One of the most common NumPy operations we’ll use in machine learning is matrix multiplication using the dot product. We take the rows of our first matrix (2) and the columns of our second matrix (2) to determine the dot product, giving us an output of [2 X 2]. The only requirement is that the inside dimensions match, in this case the first matrix has 3 columns and the second matrix has 3 rows. . # Dot product a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]], dtype=np.float64) # we can specify dtype b = np.array([[7,8], [9,10], [11, 12]], dtype=np.float64) c = a.dot(b) print (f&quot;{a.shape} · {b.shape} = {c.shape}&quot;) print (c) . (2, 3) · (3, 2) = (2, 2) [[ 58. 64.] [139. 154.]] . Axis operations . We can also do operations across a specific axis. . # Sum across a dimension x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]]) print (x) print (&quot;sum all: &quot;, np.sum(x)) # adds all elements print (&quot;sum axis=0: &quot;, np.sum(x, axis=0)) # sum across rows print (&quot;sum axis=1: &quot;, np.sum(x, axis=1)) # sum across columns . [[1 2] [3 4]] sum all: 10 sum axis=0: [4 6] sum axis=1: [3 7] . # Min/max x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]) print (&quot;min: &quot;, x.min()) print (&quot;max: &quot;, x.max()) print (&quot;min axis=0: &quot;, x.min(axis=0)) print (&quot;min axis=1: &quot;, x.min(axis=1)) . min: 1 max: 6 min axis=0: [1 2 3] min axis=1: [1 4] . Broadcasting . Here, we’re adding a vector with a scalar. Their dimensions aren’t compatible as is but how does NumPy still gives us the right result? This is where broadcasting comes in. The scalar is broadcast across the vector so that they have compatible shapes. . # Broadcasting x = np.array([1,2]) # vector y = np.array(3) # scalar z = x + y print (&quot;z: n&quot;, z) . z: [4 5] . Advanced . Transposing . We often need to change the dimensions of our tensors for operations like the dot product. If we need to switch two dimensions, we can transpose the tensor. . # Transposing x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]) print (&quot;x: n&quot;, x) print (&quot;x.shape: &quot;, x.shape) y = np.transpose(x, (1,0)) # flip dimensions at index 0 and 1 print (&quot;y: n&quot;, y) print (&quot;y.shape: &quot;, y.shape) . x: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] x.shape: (2, 3) y: [[1 4] [2 5] [3 6]] y.shape: (3, 2) . Reshaping . Sometimes, we&#39;ll need to alter the dimensions of the matrix. Reshaping allows us to transform a tensor into different permissible shapes -- our reshaped tensor has the same amount of values in the tensor. (1X6 = 2X3). We can also use -1 on a dimension and NumPy will infer the dimension based on our input tensor. . The way reshape works is by looking at each dimension of the new tensor and separating our original tensor into that many units. So here the dimension at index 0 of the new tensor is 2 so we divide our original tensor into 2 units, and each of those has 3 values. . # Reshaping x = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5,6]]) print (x) print (&quot;x.shape: &quot;, x.shape) y = np.reshape(x, (2, 3)) print (&quot;y: n&quot;, y) print (&quot;y.shape: &quot;, y.shape) z = np.reshape(x, (2, -1)) print (&quot;z: n&quot;, z) print (&quot;z.shape: &quot;, z.shape) . [[1 2 3 4 5 6]] x.shape: (1, 6) y: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] y.shape: (2, 3) z: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] z.shape: (2, 3) . Unintended reshaping . Though reshaping is very convenient to manipulate tensors, we must be careful of their pitfalls as well. Let&#39;s look at the example below. Suppose we have x, which has the shape [2 X 3 X 4]. . [[[ 1 1 1 1] [ 2 2 2 2] [ 3 3 3 3]] [[10 10 10 10] [20 20 20 20] [30 30 30 30]]] . We want to reshape x so that it has shape [3 X 8] which we&#39;ll get by moving the dimension at index 0 to become the dimension at index 1 and then combining the last two dimensions. But when we do this, we want our output . to look like: ✅ . [[ 1 1 1 1 10 10 10 10] [ 2 2 2 2 20 20 20 20] [ 3 3 3 3 30 30 30 30]] . and not like: ❌ . [[ 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2] [ 3 3 3 3 10 10 10 10] [20 20 20 20 30 30 30 30]] . even though they both have the same shape [3X8]. . x = np.array([[[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3]], [[10, 10, 10, 10], [20, 20, 20, 20], [30, 30, 30, 30]]]) print (&quot;x: n&quot;, x) print (&quot;x.shape: &quot;, x.shape) . x: [[[ 1 1 1 1] [ 2 2 2 2] [ 3 3 3 3]] [[10 10 10 10] [20 20 20 20] [30 30 30 30]]] x.shape: (2, 3, 4) . When we naively do a reshape, we get the right shape but the values are not what we&#39;re looking for. . # Unintended reshaping z_incorrect = np.reshape(x, (x.shape[1], -1)) print (&quot;z_incorrect: n&quot;, z_incorrect) print (&quot;z_incorrect.shape: &quot;, z_incorrect.shape) . z_incorrect: [[ 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2] [ 3 3 3 3 10 10 10 10] [20 20 20 20 30 30 30 30]] z_incorrect.shape: (3, 8) . Instead, if we transpose the tensor and then do a reshape, we get our desired tensor. Transpose allows us to put our two vectors that we want to combine together and then we use reshape to join them together. Always create a dummy example like this when you’re unsure about reshaping. Blindly going by the tensor shape can lead to lots of issues downstream. . # Intended reshaping y = np.transpose(x, (1,0,2)) print (&quot;y: n&quot;, y) print (&quot;y.shape: &quot;, y.shape) z_correct = np.reshape(y, (y.shape[0], -1)) print (&quot;z_correct: n&quot;, z_correct) print (&quot;z_correct.shape: &quot;, z_correct.shape) . y: [[[ 1 1 1 1] [10 10 10 10]] [[ 2 2 2 2] [20 20 20 20]] [[ 3 3 3 3] [30 30 30 30]]] y.shape: (3, 2, 4) z_correct: [[ 1 1 1 1 10 10 10 10] [ 2 2 2 2 20 20 20 20] [ 3 3 3 3 30 30 30 30]] z_correct.shape: (3, 8) . Adding/removing dimensions . We can also easily add and remove dimensions to our tensors and we&#39;ll want to do this to make tensors compatible for certain operations. . # Adding dimensions x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]) print (&quot;x: n&quot;, x) print (&quot;x.shape: &quot;, x.shape) y = np.expand_dims(x, 1) # expand dim 1 print (&quot;y: n&quot;, y) print (&quot;y.shape: &quot;, y.shape) # notice extra set of brackets are added . x: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] x.shape: (2, 3) y: [[[1 2 3]] [[4 5 6]]] y.shape: (2, 1, 3) . # Removing dimensions x = np.array([[[1,2,3]],[[4,5,6]]]) print (&quot;x: n&quot;, x) print (&quot;x.shape: &quot;, x.shape) y = np.squeeze(x, 1) # squeeze dim 1 print (&quot;y: n&quot;, y) print (&quot;y.shape: &quot;, y.shape) # notice extra set of brackets are gone . x: [[[1 2 3]] [[4 5 6]]] x.shape: (2, 1, 3) y: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] y.shape: (2, 3) .
